# Binary Calculator

## Project Overview

The **Binary Calculator** is a web-based application that allows users to perform arithmetic operations on binary numbers. Users can enter two binary numbers, select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division), and see the result displayed in binary format. The application also keeps track of the calculation history.

## Installation

To run the Binary Calculator locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd binary-calculator
   ```

2. **Open the `index.html` file** in your web browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html # For macOS
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   start index.html # For Windows
   ```

No additional software or dependencies are required to run this application, as it consists of plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

1. Enter the first binary number in the input field labeled "Enter first binary number".
2. Select the desired arithmetic operation from the dropdown menu.
3. Enter the second binary number in the input field labeled "Enter second binary number".
4. Click on the "Calculate" button to see the result.
5. The result will be displayed below the button, and you can view your calculation history in the History section.

## Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations on binary numbers: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Input validation to ensure only valid binary numbers are processed.
- Display of results in binary format.
- Historical tracking of calculations with timestamps.

## Dependencies

No external libraries or frameworks are used in this project. The application is built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
